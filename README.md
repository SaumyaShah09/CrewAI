# 🤖 CrewAI Projects Repository

This repository showcases advanced AI agent workflows built using **[CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/)** — a framework to orchestrate collaborative, multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs).

Each notebook/script demonstrates how multiple agents can coordinate to break down complex tasks like research, summarization, article writing, and report generation.
